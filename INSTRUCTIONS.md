The CNC cut parts were run while simultaneously using the templates to cut notches in the edges of the other plywood sheets

With the parts all cut 2x4s were run along the seams to provide a medium to screw into and the plywood parts for the internal walls were slotted and screwed into place

Ridid foam insulation was then bonded into the wall with construction adhesive to form one side of a SIP panel, and the outer wall section was slotted into place.
